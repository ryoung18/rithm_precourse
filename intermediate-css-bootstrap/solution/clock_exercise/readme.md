# CSS Transforms, Transitions and Animations Exercise

Using your newfound knowledge of CSS Animations, build a clock using entirely HTML and CSS! 

![./clock.gif](./clock.gif)

There are a couple of things to note. First, the clock image above runs at 10x the speed of an actual clock; your clock should move at a normal rate. Second, you know enough CSS now to make your clock much nicer looking than this one!

(Hint: you may need to look into the `transform-origin` property when building your animation. Good luck.)
